# Source Code Samples

These folders contains some (but possibly not all) of the source code I have contributed in _BrainStorm_ Project.

## Detailed Breakdown

* Enemy: Wrote several scripts that controls the behavior of enemy characters.
* Environment: Wrote a scripts that holds the character on platform, and wrote two other scripts that controls the movement of platform.
* Managers: I am responsible for the EnemyManager script as I was in charge of enemy character behaviors in general.   
* Player: Created ```spawn.cs``` that spawns enemy characters on the portal.
