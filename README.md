# BrainStorm

_Brainstorm_ is an educational 3D side scroller game that aims to teach young students (elementary school aged) basic neuroscience and brain structure. Explore inside the brain, manipulate the brain structure, and defeat the enemies that are invading our brain!

This video game was created using Unity 3D engine. In order to host this game on GitHub, this version of game was published for WebGL.
